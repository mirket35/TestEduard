<p>For this project, I created a Public Service Announcement (PSA) about weight loss. The video focuses on healthy and realistic approaches to losing weight, such as balanced eating, regular exercise, and staying motivated. I wanted to raise awareness about the importance of setting achievable goals and avoiding harmful crash diets. The PSA encourages viewers to take small, consistent steps toward a healthier lifestyle.</p>
